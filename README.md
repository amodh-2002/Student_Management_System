# Student Management System

The Student Management System (SMS) is an application developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP. This application automates administrative tasks in educational institutions, including student information management and academic record keeping. We chose HTML for structuring web pages, CSS for styling and layout, and PHP for server-side scripting to handle the backend functionality.

During development, we faced challenges such as ensuring data security, optimizing performance, and implementing robust user authentication. In the future, we plan to enhance the SMS by incorporating additional features like online grade submission, parent-teacher communication, and integration with other systems like Learning Management Systems. We also aim to improve the user interface and provide customizable reporting options to meet specific institution requirements.

## How to Install and Run the Project 
* Clone the repository using the git clone command or download the zip file and extract its contents.

* Depending on your cross-platform web server, such as XAMPP, navigate to the appropriate directory (i.e htdocs) and transfer the unzipped SMS files.

* Start the XAMPP server, which includes the MySQL Database and Apache Web Server. Ensure both services are running.

* Open a web browser and type 127.0.0.1:80/FileName/index.php, replacing FileName with the actual file name or folder structure you have in place.

* Hit enter, and you will be directed to the SMS web app. Now, you can start using the application for your specific purposes, such as managing student information and academic records

## Finally, please feel free to make any changes and improvements as needed.
